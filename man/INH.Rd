Inhalation of resuspended soil particles
}
\description{
Estimates the Intake rate of chemicals by inhalation of resuspended soil particles  [mg/Kg*day]
}
\usage{
INH(C = 10, EF = 350, ED = 24, PEF = 1.36^9, AT = 365 * ED)
}

\arguments{
  \item{C}{
Concentration of chemicals in soil(mg/kg)
}
  \item{EF}{
Exposure frequency (day/year)
}
  \item{ED}{
Exposure duration (years)
}
  \item{PEF}{
Particle emision factor meaning resuspended particles(m^3/kg)
}
  \item{AT}{
Averaging time [day] (Note that for No carcinogenic effects AT should be equal to 365*ED)
}
}

\value{
Chemical intake rate by inhalation of soil particles I [mg/Kg*day] - Object class "numeric"
