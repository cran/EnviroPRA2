Chemical intake by ingestion of vegetables
}
\description{
Estimates the chemical Intake rate by ingestion of contaminated fruits and vegetables [mg/Kg*day]
}
\usage{
VI(CF = 1, IR = 210, FI = 1, EF = 350, ED = 24, BW = 80, AT = 365 * 70)
}

\arguments{
  \item{CF}{
Chemical concentration in food [mg/Kg]
}
  \item{IR}{
Vegetables Ingestion Rate [g / Kg * Day]}
  \item{FI}{
Fraction ingested from contaminated source [-]
}
  \item{EF}{
Exposure frequency [day/yr]}
  \item{ED}{
Exposure duration [yr]}
  \item{BW}{
Body weight (kg)}
  \item{AT}{
Averaging time [day] (For No carcinogenic effects AT = 365*ED)}
}

\value{
